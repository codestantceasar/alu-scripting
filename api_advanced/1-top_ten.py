Module: 1-top_ten
Description:
    This module defines the function 'top_ten' that queries the Reddit API 
    to retrieve the top 10 hot posts for a given subreddit and prints their titles.
    
    If the subreddit is invalid (or a redirect occurs), the function prints None.
    
Usage:
    Import and call the function:
        from 1-top_ten import top_ten
        top_ten("programming")
        
    Or run the module as a script:
        $ python3 1-top_ten.py programming

    In the latter case, the script expects a single command-line argument
    representing the subreddit to query.

Requirements:
    - The 'requests' library must be installed (install it using 'pip install requests').
    
Notes:
    - A custom User-Agent header is used to ensure proper responses from the API.
    - Redirects are disabled (allow_redirects=False) to properly catch invalid subreddits.
    
Example:
    $ python3 1-top_ten.py programming
